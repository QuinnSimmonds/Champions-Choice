    "**What This Model Learned:**\n",
    "- Sport-to-sport purchase associations\n",
    "- Overall sport popularity rankings\n",
    "- Product groupings by sport\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works With Real Products:**\n",
    "1. Real customer buys a product with sport=\"Soccer\"\n",
    "2. Model knows: \"Soccer buyers also like Basketball (60%), Football (40%)\"\n",
    "3. Recommender returns: More Soccer products + some Basketball/Football products\n",
    "4. Works with ANY products that have sport categories!\n",

    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "1. Update `Recommender.py` to use these artifacts\n",
    "2. Modify recommendation logic to match by sport\n",
    "3. Update FastAPI endpoints to pass sport information"
